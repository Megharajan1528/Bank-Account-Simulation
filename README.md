# 🏦 Bank Account Simulation (Java OOP)

A simple Java-based project that simulates basic bank operations such as deposits, withdrawals, and maintaining transaction history using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

---

## 📌 Objective

Simulate real-world banking scenarios using Java OOP by implementing:

* Account creation
* Deposit & withdrawal operations
* Balance tracking
* Transaction history logging

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* **Java**
* **VS Code** (or any Java IDE)
* **Terminal / Command Line**

---

## 📦 Deliverables

A class-based Java program that:

* Uses OOP principles
* Manages account balance
* Records and displays each transaction

---

## ✨ Features

* `Account` class with methods:

  * `deposit(amount)`
  * `withdraw(amount)`
  * `getBalance()`
* Uses `ArrayList` to maintain transaction logs
* Validates withdrawal amounts
* Prints full transaction history

---

## 🧩 Mini Guide

1. Create an `Account` class with deposit and withdraw methods.
2. Use an ArrayList to store transaction details.
3. Maintain and update the balance after every transaction.
4. Display transaction history on request.
